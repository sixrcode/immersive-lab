## Phase 2 Project Schedule

### Foundational Work & Refactoring

#### 1. Architectural Consolidation: AI Services
- **Task:** Resolve overlap between `aiApi` function and `Prompt Generation service`.
    - **Sub-task:** Decide on a single implementation path.
    - **Sub-task:** Migrate/deprecate the redundant service.
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD
- **Notes:** Critical for reducing complexity and avoiding merge conflicts.

#### 2. Architectural Consolidation: Script Analyzer
- **Task:** Migrate Script Analyzer entirely into the AI microservice.
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

#### 3. Data Management Strategy: Collaboration Service
- **Task:** Evaluate migrating Collaboration Service from MongoDB to Firestore.
    - **Sub-task:** Analyze pros and cons (complexity, scalability, consistency).
    - **Sub-task:** Technical analysis of migration effort (Collaboration Service to Firestore).
    - **Sub-task:** Impact assessment on existing features and development velocity.
    - **Sub-task:** Decision point: Proceed with migration or define robust integration patterns for MongoDB & Firestore.
    - **Sub-task:** If migration approved: Detailed migration plan (data mapping, testing, rollout).
    - **Sub-task:** If integration chosen: Document clear data ownership, synchronization mechanisms, and potential API gateway strategies.
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD (Evaluation: X weeks, Migration: Y weeks if chosen)
- **Notes:** Aim to improve data consistency and reduce complexity. This is a potential blocker if not addressed early.

### AI Feature Enhancements

#### 4. AI Output Benchmarking & Evaluation
- **Task:** Define and implement benchmarking and evaluation for AI outputs.
    - **Sub-task:** Define baseline generation times.
    - **Sub-task:** Create sample prompts for measuring output quality and consistency.
    - **Sub-task:** Implement monitoring and logging for AI services (latency, error rates).
- **Dependencies:** Foundational AI services in place.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD
- **Notes:** Crucial for tracking improvements and detecting regressions.

#### 5. Storyboard Studio - Full Implementation
- **Task:** Implement real AI image generation for Storyboard Studio.
    - **Sub-task:** Integrate Genkit for actual image generation.
    - **Sub-task:** Allow import of Prompt Studio outputs (shot lists, styles).
- **Dependencies:** `ai-microservice` ready for new Genkit flows.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD
- **Notes:** Storyboard Studio MVP is already in place. This task focuses on full functionality. Timelines may need adjustment due to the earlier-than-planned start of this feature.

#### 6. Prompt-to-Prototype Studio - Enhancements
- **Task:** Implement Phase 2 enhancements (e.g., creative block refinements, interactive editing, selective regeneration).
- **Dependencies:** Core Prompt-to-Prototype Studio.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

#### 7. AI Script Analyzer - Enhancements
- **Task:** Implement more nuanced script analysis feedback.
- **Dependencies:** Core AI Script Analyzer.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

### Feature Development & Integration

#### 8. Production Board - Full Functionality
- **Task:** Build out full Production Board functionality (workflow/kanban).
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

#### 9. Real-Time Collaboration - Enhancements
- **Task:** Advance Real-Time Collaboration features (version history, comments, presence).
- **Dependencies:** Existing collaboration service. Potential dependency on data management strategy decision.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

#### 10. Portfolio & Community Features - Growth
- **Task:** Expand portfolio and community features (project feedback mechanisms, discovery).
- **Dependencies:** Existing portfolio service.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

### Performance & Scalability

#### 11. Performance Optimizations
- **Task:** Implement performance optimizations (e.g., streaming responses for Storyboard generation).
    - **Sub-task:** Load-test new pipeline with larger prompts/images.
    - **Sub-task:** Investigate edge computation and caching.
- **Dependencies:** Key features (Storyboard, Prompt Gen) in place for testing.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

#### 12. Concurrency Controls
- **Task:** Implement queuing or concurrency controls for prompt generation service.
- **Dependencies:** Prompt generation service.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD

### General Project Tasks

#### Buffer Time
- **Task:** Allocate buffer time for code reviews, testing, and unexpected delays across all major feature deliveries.
- **Estimated Timeframe:** Calculated as a percentage of total feature time or specific blocks per milestone.

### Risk Management

#### 13. Contingency Planning for AI Dependencies
- **Task:** Establish proactive measures for managing dependencies on external AI services.
    - **Sub-task:** Regularly monitor Genkit and Google AI model API updates, changes, and potential deprecations.
    - **Sub-task:** Identify and evaluate alternative AI models or services for critical features (Prompt-to-Prototype, Storyboard, Script Analysis).
    - **Sub-task:** Develop strategies for caching AI-generated results to mitigate impact from API limits or latency issues.
    - **Sub-task:** Define a response plan for significant changes in third-party AI service availability or terms.
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Estimated Timeframe:** TBD (Ongoing)
- **Notes:** Crucial for mitigating risks to Phase 2 deliverables and ensuring project continuity.
