# Roadmap Synchronization and Active Use Guidelines

This document outlines guidelines for achieving team consensus on the project roadmap and ensuring its active use, particularly in relation to `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`.

### 1. Purpose of Roadmap Sync
The primary objectives of roadmap synchronization meetings are to:
- Align all teams (Frontend, Backend, AI, Design, Product) on the overarching Phase 2 goals and the detailed tasks within `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`.
- Ensure sequenced feature development and integration to minimize merge conflicts, rework, and delays.
- Collaboratively adjust timelines and task priorities based on actual team velocity, unforeseen delays, or changes in dependencies.
- Foster a shared understanding of the project plan, promote collective ownership, and ensure all team members are working towards common milestones.

### 2. Suggested Sync Meeting / Sprint Planning Agenda
A typical agenda for roadmap sync meetings (which can be integrated into sprint planning sessions) should include:
- **Review `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`:**
    - Walk through tasks currently in progress, upcoming tasks, and their status.
    - Review dependencies between tasks, especially cross-team dependencies.
    - Discuss estimated vs. actual timelines for recently completed tasks.
- **Identify Blockers & Risks:**
    - Open forum for teams to raise any new or ongoing challenges, technical hurdles, or resource constraints.
    - Review risks noted in `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md` (e.g., Data Management Strategy, AI Dependencies) and discuss mitigation progress.
- **Cross-Team Dependencies:**
    - Explicitly discuss and confirm inter-team handoffs, API contracts, and integration points.
    - Ensure teams are aligned on the timing and requirements for dependent tasks.
- **Velocity & Timeline Adjustments:**
    - Review overall progress against the `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`.
    - Based on current velocity and any identified blockers, make necessary, consensus-driven adjustments to the schedule.
    - Clearly communicate any changes to affected teams.
- **Confirm Priorities:**
    - Re-confirm alignment on the most critical tasks for the upcoming development cycle/sprint.
    - Ensure that these priorities still align with the overall Phase 2 goals.
- **Resource Allocation Check:**
    - Briefly check if teams have the necessary personnel, tools, and access for their upcoming tasks.
- **Action Item Assignment:**
    - Clearly define, assign owners, and set due dates for any follow-up actions identified during the meeting.

### 3. Frequency
- **Initial Sync:** An initial cross-team sync meeting should be held to review, discuss, and formally approve the `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`.
- **Regular Sync Points:**
    - At the start of each major development cycle or sprint to align on immediate tasks.
    - A dedicated, broader roadmap sync meeting should occur at a regular cadence (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly, depending on the project's pace and phase length) to review overall progress, adjust long-term plans, and address strategic issues.

### 4. Active Use in Sprint Planning
The `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md` is not a static document; it should be an active tool in day-to-day development:
- **Reference Point:** `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md` should serve as a primary input and reference document during individual team sprint planning sessions.
- **Task Breakdown:** Sprint tasks and user stories should clearly map to the higher-level tasks and features outlined in the schedule. This ensures traceability and alignment.
- **Preventing Scope Creep:** Any proposed tasks or features not currently reflected in `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md` must be explicitly discussed in a roadmap sync meeting. They should be evaluated against Phase 2 goals and approved (including any necessary schedule adjustments) before being added to a sprint.
- **Alignment Check:** Sprint goals and backlogs should be regularly checked to ensure they directly contribute to the phased goals and priorities outlined in the `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`.

### 5. Achieving and Documenting Consensus
To ensure buy-in and clarity:
- **Team Lead Sign-off:** After significant updates or at the initial approval of `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md`, team leads (or designated representatives from each key area) should formally confirm their agreement with the plan. This can be a documented step in meeting minutes.
- **Meeting Minutes:** Key decisions, significant discussions, timeline adjustments, identified risks, and consensus points from sync meetings must be documented concisely and shared promptly with all relevant stakeholders.
- **Visibility:** The `PHASE_2_SCHEDULE.md` document, along with meeting minutes and action items, should be stored in a central, easily accessible location for all team members (e.g., project wiki, shared drive).
- **Feedback Loop:** Establish and encourage a continuous feedback loop where team members can raise questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the roadmap and schedule, even outside of formal sync meetings. This can be via a dedicated communication channel or during regular team meetings.

By adhering to these guidelines, the team can maintain alignment, proactively manage the project's progression, and increase the likelihood of successfully delivering Phase 2.
