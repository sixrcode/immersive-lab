# Collaboration Service

The Collaboration Service is responsible for managing projects, documents, and real-time collaboration features within the Immersive Lab platform.

## Features
*   Project creation, management, and membership.
*   Real-time collaborative document editing (details TBD).
*   Chat functionality within projects.

## API Endpoints
(Details of API endpoints can be added here or linked to a separate API documentation file.)

## Data Synchronization

The Collaboration Service plays a key role in maintaining data consistency for project metadata across the platform. It acts as the source of truth for project information (e.g., name, description, members).

When projects are created, updated (e.g., renamed), or deleted through this service's API, it triggers internal events. These events are handled by the `firestoreSyncService` (located within this service) which then propagates necessary changes to other data stores, such as Firestore, to ensure that related data (like storyboards or prototypes) is kept consistent.

For a detailed explanation of the overall data consistency strategy, please refer to the [Data Consistency Strategy document](../../docs/data_consistency_strategy.md).
