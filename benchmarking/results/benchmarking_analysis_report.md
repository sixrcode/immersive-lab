**Benchmark Analysis Report**

**Date of Benchmark Run:** 2025-06-20 (as per results file timestamp)
**Benchmark Script:** `benchmarking/run_benchmarks.js`
**Results File Analyzed:** `benchmarking/results/benchmark_results_2025-06-20T06-20-07.555Z.json`

**Overall Summary:**

The benchmark script was executed to assess the performance and output completeness of the AI microservice for the `promptToPrototype` and `analyzeScript` features using a fresh set of sample inputs. However, during the execution, the AI microservice was not reachable at the configured endpoint (`http://localhost:5001/your-project-id/us-central1/aiApi`). Consequently, all API calls made by the benchmark script resulted in connection refused errors.

While this prevented the assessment of actual AI model performance and output field completeness, the benchmark run provided insights into the script's error handling capabilities.

**Concrete Findings:**

1.  **Service Unavailability Impact:**
    *   **Observation:** All 8 benchmark tests (5 for `promptToPrototype` and 3 for `analyzeScript`) consistently failed to connect to the AI service. Each test reported an `ECONNREFUSED` error in the `errorDetails` field (e.g., `"message": "connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5001"`).
    *   **Impact:** This universal failure meant that no AI processing occurred, and therefore, metrics related to response content (like `completenessCheck` for specific fields) or actual processing latency could not be gathered.

2.  **Benchmark Script Error Reporting:**
    *   **Observation:** The `run_benchmarks.js` script demonstrated robust error handling in the face of service unavailability. For every failed connection:
        *   `successStatus` was correctly marked as `false`.
        *   `completenessCheck` was correctly marked as `false` (as no data was returned to check).
        *   `httpStatusCode` was `null`, accurately reflecting that no HTTP response was received.
        *   `responseData` was `null`.
        *   The `errorDetails` object contained the specific network error code (`ECONNREFUSED`).
    *   **Significance:** This behavior is desirable as it clearly indicates to the user running the benchmarks that the issues are related to service accessibility rather than problems within the AI service's logic or output generation itself (had the service been reachable). The very short `responseTime` values recorded (e.g., 2ms to 28ms) are consistent with immediate connection failures.

**Recommendations:**

*   To obtain meaningful AI performance and output quality metrics, ensure the AI microservice (`aiApi`) is running and accessible at the specified `BENCHMARK_API_BASE_URL` when executing the benchmark script.
*   The current benchmark script's error logging is clear for connection failures. No changes are needed for this specific scenario.

This report highlights the outcome of the benchmark execution under the given conditions.
