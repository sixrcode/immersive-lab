# AI Feature Benchmark Results - V2 (Conceptual: Image Handling Improvement)

Date: 2025-06-20
Improvement Focus: Optimized image handling in the `promptToPrototype` flow.
Related Issue: MLBench-B (Implement one improvement based on benchmark findings)
Previous Benchmark: `BENCHMARK_RESULTS_V1.md`

## 1. Description of Change

The `promptToPrototype` flow in `ai-microservice/src/flows/prompt-to-prototype.ts` was modified to improve the handling of AI-generated mood board images.

Previously, if the AI model generated a mood board image as a base64 data URI, this data URI was returned directly in the `moodBoardImage` field of the output. This could lead to large data URIs being stored in Firestore, causing database bloat and slower client-side retrieval.

The implemented change is as follows:
- After the AI generates the `moodBoardImage`:
  - If the image is a base64 data URI, it is now uploaded to Firebase Cloud Storage.
  - The `moodBoardImage` field in the output is then populated with the resulting GCS URL.
  - If the upload to GCS fails, the `moodBoardImage` field is set to a specific placeholder: `https://placehold.co/600x400.png?text=Image+Storage+Failed`.
  - If the AI initially fails to generate an image, the placeholder remains `https://placehold.co/600x400.png?text=Image+Gen+Failed`.
  - If the AI returns a non-data URI (e.g., already a GCS URL), that URL is used directly without attempting re-upload.

Unit tests have been added in `ai-microservice/src/flows/prompt-to-prototype.test.ts` to cover these new logic paths.

## 2. Conceptual Benchmark Impact Assessment

The most recent full benchmark run (`benchmark_results_2025-06-20T06-20-07.555Z.json`) failed due to service unavailability. Therefore, a direct before/after comparison with a live benchmark run for this specific change is not available at this moment. The following assessment is based on the `BENCHMARK_RESULTS_V1.md` baseline and the expected effects of the implemented change.

### 2.1. `promptToPrototype` Feature

**Targeted Aspects**:
*   Efficiency of `moodBoardImage` storage and retrieval.
*   Reliability and clarity of the `moodBoardImage` URL.
*   Qualitative score for `moodBoardImage`.
*   Potential impact on flow latency.

**Expected Outcomes**:

*   **`moodBoardImage` URL Format**:
    *   **Before (V1)**: Could be a base64 data URI or a placeholder.
    *   **After (Conceptual V2)**: Will be a GCS URL for successfully AI-generated and stored images, or one of two specific placeholders (`Image+Gen+Failed` or `Image+Storage+Failed`). This improves consistency and actionability of the URL.

*   **Qualitative Score for `moodBoardImage` (Scale 1-5)**:
    *   **Baseline (V1, excluding input error sample `prompt_005`):** Average ~3.0.
    *   **Expected (Conceptual V2):** Average ~3.5 for successfully generated and stored images. This modest improvement is anticipated due to more robust handling, clearer failure states, and elimination of potentially problematic large data URIs being passed to clients. The AI's core image generation quality is assumed constant.

*   **Response Time (Latency)**:
    *   **Baseline (V1 Average):** 2038 ms.
    *   **Expected (Conceptual V2):** A potential slight increase in average latency (e.g., +100-500ms) for cases where the AI generates a data URI, due to the added GCS upload step. This is a trade-off for improved storage and client performance.

*   **Storage Efficiency (Not directly measured by `run_benchmarks.js`)**:
    *   **Before (V1)**: Potentially large base64 data URIs stored in Firestore.
    *   **After (Conceptual V2)**: Significant reduction in Firestore document size for `promptToPrototype` outputs, as large images are replaced by short GCS URLs. This improves database health and reduces costs.

*   **Client-Side Performance (Not directly measured by `run_benchmarks.js`)**:
    *   **Before (V1)**: Clients might download and process large base64 data URIs.
    *   **After (Conceptual V2)**: Clients will download smaller payloads and load images from GCS URLs, which is generally more efficient.

*   **Success Rate (HTTP 200 & Completeness Check Pass)**:
    *   **Baseline (V1):** 100%.
    *   **Expected (Conceptual V2):** Expected to remain 100%. The change should not affect the basic completeness check (field presence) or HTTP success, assuming GCS uploads are generally reliable or fall back to the placeholder correctly.

## 3. Next Steps

*   Ensure the AI microservice is reliably accessible.
*   Perform a full benchmark run using `benchmarking/run_benchmarks.js` to obtain actual "after" metrics for this change and validate the conceptual assessment.
*   Update this document with the results of the actual benchmark run when available.
