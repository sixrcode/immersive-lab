# Genkit/Google AI Configuration
# By default, Genkit with the googleAI() plugin will attempt to use Application Default Credentials (ADC).
# If ADC is not configured or you need to use a specific API key for Google AI services (like Gemini):
# GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key"
# Note: Ensure this key has access to "Generative Language API" or "Vertex AI API" as needed.

# Application Specific Variables (if any)
# Example:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_FEATURE_FLAG_XYZ="true"

# === Collaboration Service ===
# Base URL for the Collaboration Microservice API
# - Use proxy path for local Next.js development if configured in next.config.js
NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLABORATION_API_BASE_URL=/api/collaboration
# Example for direct local access:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLABORATION_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
# Example for production deployment:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_COLLABORATION_API_BASE_URL=https://your-collaboration-service.run.app/api

# === AI Microservice ===
# Base URL for the Centralized AI Microservice (aiApi Firebase Function)
# This service handles various AI tasks including Prompt-to-Prototype generation,
# script analysis, and storyboard generation.
# This URL should point to the 'aiApi' Firebase Function.
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MICROSERVICE_URL="your_ai_microservice_functions_url"
# Example for a deployed Firebase Function:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MICROSERVICE_URL=https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/aiApi
# For local development, if you are using the Firebase emulator for functions:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MICROSERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001/your-project-id/us-central1/aiApi


# === Prompt Generation Service (DEPRECATED for Prompt-to-Prototype) ===
# Base URL for the original Prompt Generation Microservice.
# This service's prompt-to-prototype functionality has been consolidated into the AI Microservice (see NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MICROSERVICE_URL).
# This variable is kept for historical reference or if the service is used for other purposes.
# It is NO LONGER USED by the Next.js app for prompt generation.
