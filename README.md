ISL.SIXR.tv is the digital home of the Immersive Storytelling Lab, a project by SIXR aimed at empowering underrepresented youth and independent creators to master immersive storytelling techniques using VR, XR, AI filmmaking, and open-source creative tools.

## Features

The Immersive Storytelling Lab Platform (ISL.SIXR.tv) offers a suite of tools designed to support creators through every stage of the immersive storytelling process. Key features include:

-   **Tutorial Discovery Engine:** A curated database of tutorials and learning materials focused on VR, XR, AI filmmaking, and open-source creative tools. (Vision as per documentation)
-   **Community Showcase:** A space for creators to share their projects, get feedback, and connect with peers. (Basic portfolio functionality currently present, supported by the Portfolio Microservice. See Microservices Architecture section for details.)
-   **Resources Hub:** A collection of links to essential tools, assets, and documentation for immersive content creation. (Vision as per documentation)
-   **AI Script Analyzer:** Provides insights on script pacing, character arcs, and potential plot holes. (Detailed in Microservices Architecture section)
-   **Prompt-to-Prototype Studio (Phase 1: Core Generation):** Generates a comprehensive set of creative assets (loglines, mood board, shot list, animatic description, pitch summary) from a user's prompt, optional image, and style preset. Results are stored in Firestore and Firebase Storage, with a JSON download option. (Actively developed/present in UI)
-   **Production Board (Production-Gate Board):** Helps manage the production workflow, from pre-production to final output. (Actively developed/present in UI)
-   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Allows multiple users to work together on creative projects in real-time. (Supported by the Collaboration Service. See Microservices Architecture section for details.)
-   **Authentication and User Profiles:** Secure user accounts and personalized profiles for managing projects and contributions.

## System Architecture

The ISL.SIXR.tv platform employs a modern web architecture:

-   **Frontend & BFF (Backend-For-Frontend):** The primary application is built with Next.js, serving both as the user interface and a backend layer that handles user authentication, data management with Firestore, and orchestration of calls to other services.

Below is a textual representation of the system components and their interactions:

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
-   **Firebase**: This project uses Firebase for its backend services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage).
    -   Ensure you have a Firebase project set up.
    -   For backend functionalities like image uploads and data storage for the Prompt-to-Prototype Studio, you will need to configure Firebase Admin SDK credentials via environment variables. Refer to `src/lib/firebase/admin.ts` for the required variables (`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`).
    -   Client-side Firebase configuration will also be needed (typically in a Firebase config file or environment variables like `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_...`).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sixrcode/immersive-lab.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd project-directory-name
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:9002` (or another port if configured).

### Environment Variables (Next.js App)

Before running the Next.js application, ensure you have a `.env.local` file in the root of the Next.js project with the following variables:

-   **Firebase Client SDK Configuration:**
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your_api_key"`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your_auth_domain"`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_storage_bucket"`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your_messaging_sender_id"`
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your_app_id"`
-   **Firebase Admin SDK Configuration (for server-side operations in Next.js API routes, if any remain that are not offloaded to the microservice):**
    -   `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"`
    -   `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="your_firebase_admin_client_email"`
    -   `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your_firebase_admin_private_key"` (Ensure newlines are correctly formatted, e.g., by using `\n` in the string or by using base64 encoding)
    -   `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your_storage_bucket_name"`
-   **AI Microservice URL:**
    -   `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MICROSERVICE_URL="your_ai_microservice_functions_url"` (e.g., `https://us-central1-your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/aiApi`)

Replace `"your_..."` placeholders with your actual Firebase project configuration values.

## üß™ Testing

This section outlines how to run tests, the frameworks used, and general testing guidelines for the ISL.SIXR.tv platform.

### Running Tests

-   **Root Project Tests:** To run all tests defined in the root project (primarily frontend component tests and potentially integration tests), use the following command from the project root:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
-   **Microservice-Specific Tests:** Some microservices have their own dedicated test suites. To run these, navigate to the microservice directory and execute its test command (typically also `npm run test` if a `test` script is defined in its `package.json`):
    ```bash
    # Example for ai-microservice
    cd ai-microservice
    npm run test
    cd ..

    # Example for collaboration-service
    cd collaboration-service
    npm run test
    cd ..

    # Check other microservices like functions/, portfolio-microservice/ for their specific testing setups.
    ```

### Frameworks

-   **Jest:** The primary JavaScript testing framework used across the project for both frontend and backend tests. You'll find Jest configuration files (e.g., `jest.config.js`) in the root directory and within several microservice directories.
-   **React Testing Library:** Used for testing React components in the Next.js frontend, encouraging tests that interact with components as a user would.

### Test Coverage

-   Developers are encouraged to write tests for new features and bug fixes to maintain good test coverage.
-   To generate a test coverage report, you might be able to use a flag with the test command, such as:
    ```bash
    npm run test -- --coverage
    ```
    (Note: The exact command for coverage might vary based on Jest configuration in different packages.)

### Types of Tests

-   **Unit Tests:** These form the majority of tests, focusing on individual functions, modules, or components. Examples can be found in `src/components/__tests__/` for frontend components and within specific microservice test directories like `ai-microservice/index.test.js`.
-   **Integration/Flow Validation Tests:** Some tests might cover the interaction between multiple units or validate entire flows. For example, tests in `functions/test/` or `portfolio-microservice/routes/portfolio.test.js` might perform more integrated testing of API endpoints or specific flows.
-   **End-to-End Tests (Future Consideration):** While not explicitly detailed, end-to-end tests using frameworks like Cypress or Playwright could be a future addition for testing complete user flows through the UI.

## Tech Stack

ISL.SIXR.tv is built with a modern tech stack designed for scalability and a rich user experience:

-   **Next.js 13+ (App Directory):** A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications, utilizing the latest App Directory structure.
-   **Firebase:** Leveraged for backend services, including Firestore for the database and Google Authentication for user management.
-   **Genkit:** An open source framework from Google to help build, deploy and monitor AI-powered features and applications.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
-   **Radix UI (implicitly):** Used via a component library like shadcn/ui, providing a foundation of unstyled, accessible UI components.
-   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
-   **Vercel:** Used for deployment and managing serverless functions, ensuring high availability and performance.

## Deployment: Firebase Hosting & Cloud Run Strategy

This section provides a breakdown of **Firebase Hosting** vs. **Cloud Run**, including when it makes sense to use each‚Äîor both in tandem for the ISL.SIXR.tv platform.

### üîß Feature Comparison

#### Firebase Hosting

*   Excellent for static sites and SPAs, with integrated global CDN + HTTPS + custom domains + previews + easy rollbacks ([Firebase App Hosting Comparison](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting/product-comparison?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Cloud Run Custom Domains](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
*   Includes generous free tier (Spark: 1‚ÄØGB storage, 10‚ÄØGB monthly bandwidth; custom domains and SSL included). Blaze adds usage-based costs as you grow .
*   Integrates tightly with Firebase Auth, Firestore/Realtime DB, Functions, Analytics, etc.
*   Best when you want simplicity, tight Firebase service integration, and minimal backend customization.

#### Cloud Run

*   Designed for running containerized, stateless services (Node, Go, Python, Java, etc.) ([Firebase Hosting with Cloud Run](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/cloud-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
*   Auto-scales to zero or thousands of instances; billed per CPU/memory usage during active requests ([Firebase Hosting with Cloud Run](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/cloud-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
*   Offers flexibility for custom backends, microservices, REST APIs, SSR, or complex compute.
*   Can map custom domains via Firebase Hosting, Load Balancer, or Cloud Run domain mapping ([Cloud Run Custom Domains](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/mapping-custom-domains?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
*   No built-in CDN; dynamic, container response only (and a \~60s timeout from Firebase proxy) ([Reddit Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/g1wgzo/static_website_google_cloud_run_or_firebase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### üìä When to Use Which (or Both)

| Scenario                         | Firebase Hosting Only     | Cloud Run Only          | Firebase Hosting + Cloud Run                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static site / SPA**            | ‚úÖ Ideal                   | ‚ùå Overkill              | ‚ùå Not needed                                         |
| **Backend APIs / SSR**           | üöß Possible via Functions | ‚úÖ Ideal                 | ‚úÖ Great option                                       |
| **Custom runtimes / frameworks** | ‚ùå Restricted to Node.js   | ‚úÖ Full control          | ‚úÖ Use Hosting for static + rewrite APIs to Cloud Run |
| **Minimal infra management**     | ‚úÖ Very easy               | ‚öôÔ∏è You manage images    | ‚úÖ Balanced                                           |
| **Tight Firebase integration**   | ‚úÖ Full support            | ‚òëÔ∏è Possible, extra code | ‚úÖ Best of both                                       |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example Setup: Combine Firebase Hosting + Cloud Run

1.  Build your frontend and deploy via `firebase deploy`.
2.  Package backend container, deploy it to Cloud Run via `gcloud build/ run`.
3.  Add rewrite in `firebase.json`:

    ```json
    "hosting": {
      "rewrites": [{
        "source": "/api/**",
        "run": { "serviceId": "your-service", "region": "us-west1" }
      }]
    }
    ```
4.  Deploy hosting config with `firebase deploy --only hosting` ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66198081/how-to-correctly-deploy-changes-after-pairing-google-cloud-run-with-firebase-hos?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/stackups/firebase-vs-google-cloud-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

This lets Hosting handle static assets, CDN, SSL, and rewrites `/api` to your containerized microservice. That‚Äôs the sweet-spot combo.

---

### üí° Trade-offs & Tips

*   **Latency**: Proxying through Hosting adds \~600ms overhead compared to direct Cloud Run endpoints ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59068532/high-latency-using-firebase-hosting-as-compared-to-native-cloud-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
*   **Cold starts**: Containers‚Äîparticularly large Node.js ones‚Äîcan take seconds to spin up. Optimize image size (Go works great) to avoid this ([Reddit Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlecloud/comments/g1wgzo/static_website_google_cloud_run_or_firebase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
*   **Timeouts**: Firebase proxy enforces a 60s limit‚Äîlonger tasks need other solutions (e.g., App Engine Flex).
*   **Deployment complexity**: Cloud Run involves Docker builds & CI/CD, compared to one-command Firebase deploys ([Firebase Hosting with Cloud Run](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/cloud-run?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Firebase Serverless Overview](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/serverless-overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

---

### üõ§Ô∏è TL;DR: Choose Based On:

*   **Firebase Hosting alone**: Static/SPA site with minimal backend.
*   **Cloud Run alone**: Massive backend services, custom logic, full control.
*   **Combine them**: You want a fast static frontend from Hosting, plus a powerful, containerized backend‚Äîwithout building your own CDN or SSL.

---

### ‚úÖ What to Do Next

1.  **Define your app architecture**: static vs dynamic; what runtime you need.
2.  **Choose your tool(s)**:
    *   If you're a frontend-heavy project with light backend, go with Firebase Hosting (+ Cloud Functions).
    *   Need full backend flexibility or language support beyond Node? Cloud Run is your friend.
    *   Want both? Use Hosting + Cloud Run with proxies‚Äîbalanced and elegant.
3.  **Prototype a mini app**:
    *   Deploy a SPA on Hosting.
    *   Create a `/api/hello` Cloud Run service.
    *   Test rewrite configuration.
4.  **Watch latency & cold starts**; optimize container images (e.g. Alpine, Go, caching layers).

Mixing Firebase Hosting with Cloud Run gives you the best of both worlds‚Äîfast static delivery, global SSL/CDN, and backend flexibility in containers. If that aligns with SIXR‚Äôs mission‚Äîempowering creators with style and scale‚Äîthis combo is a strong play.

## üì¶ API Contracts & Shared Types

Maintaining clear API contracts and consistent data structures across the platform is crucial for interoperability between the frontend, backend (Next.js BFF), and various microservices.

-   **Shared Type Definitions:**
    -   Core platform-wide data structures and type definitions are primarily located in `src/lib/types.ts`.
    -   Specific packages or modules may also have their own type definitions, for example, shared types related to the Storyboard feature can be found in `packages/types/src/storyboard.types.ts`.
    -   These files serve as a key source of truth for data contracts, ensuring consistency in the data exchanged between different parts of the system.

-   **API Endpoint Contracts (Future: OpenAPI):**
    -   Currently, API contract details for microservices are often described within their respective `README.md` files or inferred from their implementation and the shared type definitions.
    -   We plan to expose OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications for all AI and core microservice endpoints in the future. This will facilitate clearer API contracts, easier integration, automated client generation, and improved discoverability of service capabilities.

## üîê Authentication & Roles

The platform uses Firebase Authentication to manage user identities and access control. Role-based access ensures that users have appropriate permissions based on their defined roles.

### Authentication Methods

-   **Firebase Authentication:** Core authentication is handled by Firebase.
    -   **Email/Password:** Users can sign up and log in using their email address and a password.
    -   **Google OAuth:** Users can also authenticate using their existing Google accounts for a streamlined experience.
-   **JWT for Service Access:** Upon successful authentication, Firebase ID tokens (JWTs) are issued to clients. These tokens are then sent as Bearer tokens in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected backend endpoints, particularly the AI microservices (e.g., Centralized AI Microservice).

### User Roles

The platform defines the following user roles to differentiate access and capabilities:

-   **`youth`:** Represents young creators using the platform to learn and develop projects. They typically have access to learning resources, content creation tools, and their own project spaces.
-   **`mentor`:** Represents educators or experienced individuals guiding youth users. They might have additional permissions to review youth projects, provide feedback, and manage groups.
-   **`admin`:** Represents platform administrators with full access to manage users, content, platform settings, and monitor overall activity.

Role management is typically handled via Firebase custom claims, which are set on user accounts and can be used in security rules (Firestore) and backend logic to enforce permissions.

### Key Authentication Logic

-   **Client-Side Setup:** Configuration and handling of Firebase authentication on the client-side (e.g., sign-in flows, user state management) are primarily managed in `src/lib/firebase/client.ts`.
-   **Server-Side Admin Tasks:** Firebase Admin SDK operations, such as token verification and management of custom claims for roles, are handled in `src/lib/firebase/admin.ts`.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** RBAC is implemented within specific API routes (e.g., in Next.js BFF) and microservices, checking user roles (derived from JWT claims) before allowing access to certain functionalities or data.

## Microservices Architecture

The ISL.SIXR.tv platform employs a modular, microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability, focused development, and independent deployment of its diverse functionalities. This approach is particularly beneficial for managing AI-intensive workflows, real-time collaborative features, and production support tools. Below is an overview of the key microservices, grouped by their primary function:

### AI Microservices

These services are responsible for the core AI-driven functionalities of the platform, including content generation, analysis, and AI model orchestration.

#### Prompt Generation Service (`services/prompt-gen-service/`)

*   **Purpose:** Handles the core AI-driven generation of creative assets such as loglines, mood boards, shot lists, and pitch summaries based on user prompts. It is responsible for all AI-driven content generation and image processing tasks related to the Prompt-to-Prototype Studio.
*   **Key Technologies:** Node.js, Express, Genkit
*   **Location:** `services/prompt-gen-service/`
*   **Notes:**
    *   This service operates independently from the main web application.
    *   Its architectural separation ensures the main Next.js application remains responsive and lightweight, allows the AI microservice to be deployed, monitored, and scaled independently, and maintains clear boundaries between user interface/backend logic and AI model orchestration.
    *   Communication with the frontend is handled via HTTP requests from the Next.js backend, which also manages authentication, Firestore storage, and user session context.
    *   For detailed setup, environment variables, and API reference, see the [Prompt Generation Service README](./services/prompt-gen-service/README.md).

#### Centralized AI Microservice (`ai-microservice/`)

*   **Purpose:** Acts as a primary API gateway for a range of AI functionalities beyond prompt generation. It manages Genkit flows, orchestrates communication with various AI models (e.g., Gemini via Google AI), and processes structured input from different frontend features. It serves as the backend for the Prompt-to-Prototype Studio, AI Script Analyzer, and Storyboard Studio.
*   **Key Technologies:** Firebase Function, Node.js, Express, Genkit
*   **Location:** `ai-microservice/`
*   **Authentication:** All endpoints require a valid Firebase ID token (Authorization: Bearer <token>).
*   **Endpoints:**
    *   Base URL: `https://<region>-<project-id>.cloudfunctions.net/aiApi`
    *   `POST /analyzeScript`: Accepts script content and returns a `ScriptAnalysisPackage`. Powers the AI Script Analyzer tool.
    *   `POST /promptToPrototype`: Generates a `PromptPackage` from a user prompt (with optional image/style). Used by the Prompt-to-Prototype Studio.
    *   `POST /generateStoryboard`: Returns a `StoryboardPackage` from a scene description. Intended for the Storyboard Studio.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Deploy using the command: `firebase deploy --only functions:aiApi`
    *   The resulting URL should be set as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_MICROSERVICE_URL` environment variable in the Next.js application.
*   **Note:** This service centralizes common AI tasks and model interactions, providing a consistent interface for the frontend. For more details, see the [Centralized AI Microservice README](./ai-microservice/README.md).

#### AI Script Analyzer (`functions/`)

*   **Purpose:** Analyzes textual scripts to provide users with insights on narrative elements such as pacing, character development, and potential plot inconsistencies.
*   **Key Technologies:** Firebase Function (core logic invoked by Centralized AI Microservice)
*   **Location:** The core logic resides in `functions/src_copy/ai/flows/ai-script-analyzer.ts`, with the endpoint defined in `functions/index.js`. It is invoked via the Centralized AI Microservice's `/analyzeScript` endpoint.
*   **Note:** This microservice provides specialized AI analysis for scriptwriting, integrating with the Centralized AI Microservice for API exposure. For an overview of functions in this directory, see the [Firebase Functions README](./functions/README.md).

### Collaboration & Community

These services focus on enabling user interaction, project sharing, and collaborative workflows.

## üöÄ CI/CD & Deployment Pipeline

This section outlines the continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and deployment pipeline for the ISL.SIXR.tv platform. The goal is to automate testing and deployment processes to ensure reliability and efficiency.

### Automation with GitHub Actions

-   **Core Tool:** GitHub Actions is the primary tool planned for automating CI/CD workflows. While specific workflow files (e.g., under `/.github/workflows/`) are yet to be fully implemented or made visible, the strategy is to use them extensively. (Note: Full configuration is 'coming soon' as per project status).
-   **Triggers:** Workflows are typically configured to trigger on:
    -   Push events to main branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
    -   Pull requests targeting the `main` branch to ensure code quality before merging.
-   **Common Jobs:** Automated jobs within the workflows will likely include:
    -   **Linting:** Checking code for style consistency and potential errors.
    -   **Testing:** Running unit, integration, and potentially other tests (see "üß™ Testing" section).
    -   **Building:** Compiling the Next.js application and building Docker images for containerized microservices.
    -   **Deployment:** Pushing built assets and images to their respective hosting/registry services and deploying to various environments.

### Environments

-   **Development:** Local developer setups and feature branches.
-   **Staging (Planned/To Be Detailed):** A dedicated staging or pre-production environment is crucial for testing features in a production-like setting before deploying to live users. Details on its setup and refresh cycle are to be defined.
-   **Production:** The live environment accessible to all users, deployed from a stable main branch (e.g., `main`).

### Deployment Tools & Strategies

-   **Next.js Frontend (Vercel & Firebase Hosting):**
    -   The Next.js frontend is primarily deployed using **Firebase Hosting**, leveraging its optimizations for Next.js applications (e.g., serverless functions, edge network, CI/CD integration).
    -   Alternatively, **Vercel** can serve the Next.js application during specific development phases or for exploring alternative deployment strategies, but Firebase Hosting is the main target for tighter integration with other Firebase services and the overall platform ecosystem.
    -   Deployments to **Firebase Hosting** are automated via GitHub Actions.

-   **Firebase Services (Functions, Firestore Rules, Hosting Config):**
    -   The **Firebase CLI** (`firebase deploy`) is the standard tool for deploying Firebase Functions (like the Centralized AI Microservice), Firestore security rules, and Firebase Hosting configurations.
    -   These deployments are typically scripted within GitHub Actions workflows for automation. For example, `firebase deploy --only functions:aiApi` is used for the Centralized AI Microservice.

-   **Containerized Microservices (Docker & Google Cloud Run):**
    -   **Design:** Microservices like the 'Collaboration Service' or other custom backend APIs are designed to be containerized using **Docker**.
    -   **Dockerfile:** Each containerized microservice should include a `Dockerfile` in its root directory (e.g., `collaboration-service/Dockerfile`) that defines its build environment.
    -   **Image Registry:** During the CI/CD process, Docker images are built and pushed to a container registry. **Google Artifact Registry** is the recommended choice within the Google Cloud ecosystem, though Docker Hub is also an option.
    -   **Cloud Run Deployment:** Deployment to **Google Cloud Run** is managed via `gcloud run deploy` commands. These commands specify the image URL from the registry, target region, environment variables, and other service configurations.
    -   **Scalability:** Each Cloud Run service is configured for auto-scaling, allowing it to handle varying loads efficiently, including scaling down to zero instances to save costs when not in use.

### General Workflow (Anticipated)

1.  Developers work on features in separate branches.
2.  Pull requests (PRs) are created to merge features into a main development branch (e.g., `develop`) or directly to `main` for smaller changes.
3.  GitHub Actions automatically trigger on PRs to:
    *   Run linters and format checkers.
    *   Execute test suites across the application and relevant microservices.
    *   Optionally, build the application to catch build errors early.
4.  Upon successful tests, code review, and PR approval, changes are merged.
5.  Merging to a designated deployment branch (e.g., `main` for production, `develop` for staging) triggers further GitHub Actions workflows:
    *   Builds the Next.js frontend and deploys to Vercel/Firebase Hosting.
    *   Deploys Firebase Functions and related configurations.
    *   Builds Docker images for containerized microservices, pushes them to Google Artifact Registry.
    *   Deploys the new images to Google Cloud Run services.

This structured CI/CD pipeline aims to provide a robust, automated pathway for developing, testing, and deploying updates and new features to the ISL.SIXR.tv platform, ensuring stability and rapid iteration.

## Prompt-to-Prototype Studio

The Prompt-to-Prototype Studio is a key feature of ISL.SIXR.tv, designed to rapidly convert initial ideas into a tangible set of creative assets. Users can input a text prompt, optionally upload a reference image, and select a style preset. The backend logic for generating these assets is handled by the **Centralized AI Microservice (`ai-microservice/`)**. The studio then receives and displays:

-   Multiple loglines (targeting different tones, influenced by the style preset).
-   An AI-generated mood board image (inspired by the prompt, image, and style).
-   Nine themed mood board cells with detailed textual descriptions reflecting the chosen style and inputs.
-   A detailed shot list (6-10 shots) with lens, camera move, and framing notes, adapted to the style preset.
-   An animatic description for a 4-second proxy clip, outlining key visuals and pacing, influenced by the style.
-   A concise pitch summary, capturing the core concept and tone.

All generated data is bundled into a `PromptPackage`, which is created and stored in Firestore by the Centralized AI Microservice. Images (user-uploaded and AI-generated) are also handled by the Centralized AI Microservice and saved to Firebase Cloud Storage, with their URLs included in the `PromptPackage`. The Next.js application receives this package and allows users to view the content and download it as a JSON file.

This feature is under active development. For detailed documentation on the current Phase 1 implementation, please see [Core Generation Pipeline Documentation](./docs/v1.1/core.md). The AI logic itself resides in the `ai-microservice/src/flows/prompt-to-prototype.ts` flow.

### Future Phases & Integrations:

*   **Phase 2 (Creative Block Support):** Introduce tools like "Logline Enhancer," "Mood Board Variation Generator," and "Shot List Expander" using Genkit flows to help users refine or expand on initial outputs.
*   **Phase 3 (Interactive Editing & Refinement):** Allow direct editing of generated text assets (loglines, cell descriptions, shot notes) within the UI. Implement functionality to save these edits back to the `PromptPackage` in Firestore, incrementing its version.
*   **Phase 4 (Selective Regeneration & Versioning):** Enable regeneration of specific parts of the `PromptPackage` (e.g., just the loglines, a single mood board cell, or the AI mood board image). Each regeneration or significant edit will create a new version of the package in Firestore for history and comparison.
*   **Integration with Storyboard Studio:**
    *   Generated shot lists from Prompt-to-Prototype can be directly imported into the Storyboard Studio to pre-populate scenes and panel descriptions.
    *   The selected style preset and mood board can inform the visual style for AI-generated storyboard images.
*   **Integration with Production Board:**
    *   A completed `PromptPackage` can automatically create an initial "Concept" or "Pre-Production" card on the Production Board, linking back to the prototype details.
    *   Key assets (logline, pitch summary) can populate fields on the Kanban card.
*   **Integration with Script Analyzer:**
    *   The animatic description and shot list could serve as a structural starting point for a script, which can then be analyzed and refined by the AI Script Analyzer.

This phased approach ensures that the Prompt-to-Prototype Studio becomes a deeply integrated and evolving tool, empowering creators from the initial spark of an idea through to more detailed production planning.

## üéì For Educators / Workshop Use

This section provides guidance for educators, workshop facilitators, or anyone looking to use the ISL.SIXR.tv platform in an educational setting with groups or cohorts of learners.

### Setting Up for a Cohort

-   **Fresh Firebase Instance:** It is highly recommended to deploy a fresh, dedicated Firebase instance for each new cohort or workshop group. This ensures a clean data environment (Firestore, Storage, Auth users) for each group, preventing data overlaps and simplifying management.
-   **Firebase Project Configuration:** Ensure your new Firebase project's configuration (API keys, project ID, etc.) is correctly set up in the Next.js application's environment variables (`.env.local` or deployment environment variables).

### Pre-filling Example Content (Seeding)

-   **Seed Data (Suggestion):** To provide students with a starting point or illustrative examples, consider creating a `seeds/` directory in the project root. This directory could contain:
    -   Example JSON files for prompts to be used with the Prompt-to-Prototype Studio.
    -   Sample scripts (e.g., plain text or Fountain format) that can be analyzed by the AI Script Analyzer.
    -   Example storyboard descriptions or structures.
-   **Seeding Mechanism (To Be Developed):** A script or manual process would need to be established to populate the Firestore database with this seed data. This might involve writing simple Node.js scripts that use the Firebase Admin SDK to create initial documents.

### Managing Student Accounts

-   **Firebase Authentication Users:** Create individual Firebase Authentication accounts for each student. You can do this manually via the Firebase console or programmatically using the Firebase Admin SDK.
    -   Using a consistent email pattern (e.g., `student{id}@workshop.com`) can simplify management.
-   **Assigning Roles:** Assign the `youth` role to student accounts (likely via Firebase custom claims) to ensure they have the appropriate permissions. Mentors or facilitators could be assigned the `mentor` role.

### Workshop Facilitation Tips

-   **Mentors Group in Firestore:** To manage review permissions or group students under specific mentors, consider creating a `mentors` collection in Firestore. Each document could represent a mentor and store a list of student UIDs they are responsible for. This can be used in Firestore security rules or application logic to control access.
-   **Utilize Portfolio Mode:** Encourage students to use the Portfolio microservice/feature to showcase their projects. This can be a great way for them to share their work, receive peer feedback, and build a collection of their creative outputs from the workshop.
-   **Introduce Tools Incrementally:** Depending on the workshop's focus, introduce the platform's tools (Prompt-to-Prototype, Storyboard Studio, Script Analyzer) incrementally to avoid overwhelming learners.
-   **Dedicated Q&A/Support Channel:** Set up a dedicated channel (e.g., Slack, Discord, or forum) for students to ask questions and receive support during the workshop.

By following these guidelines, educators can create a more structured and effective learning experience using the ISL.SIXR.tv platform.
